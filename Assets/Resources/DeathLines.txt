Into the eternal darkness.
The spark extinguished.
Gone into the abyss of lightlessness.
Succumbed to the shadows of time.
Fading like a lantern's glow.
Your light, a lantern, extinguished.
In the lantern's shadow, you rest.
As a lantern's glow fades, so did you.
In the lantern's silence, you found peace.
In the end, we all become embers.
Your flame flickered out.
Life's flame, now a memory.
Ashes to ashes, flame to darkness.
Your light, a fleeting flame.
In the lantern's stillness, you rest.
